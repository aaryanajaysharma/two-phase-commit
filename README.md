# Two-phase Commit Server Implementation

An implementation of [two-phase commit protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-phase_commit_protocol) 
in Python for a project in the course CS3.401: Distributed Systems, offered at IIIT-Hyderabad. We assume the network to be non-byzantine, but prone to failure.

## Installation

### Requirements

* `psycopg2`: Python Interface to PostgreSQL
* `simplyrpc`: Simple RPC implementation in python

Install using `requirements.txt`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

PostgreSQL must be installed on the system for the databases.
For `N` participants, we would need `2*N+1` independent PostgreSQL server instances to act as
seperate nodes. To spin up these databases automatically, `cd` into `setup` and run:

    python3 setup_db.py {2*N+1}

For example, if the coordinator is chosen to run at port `16000` and the `i`th participant at `16000+i`, then 
* Database ports
    * For coordinator `logdb`: `15001` (say)
    * For participant `i`, `logdb`: `15000+(2*i)`
    * For participant `i`, `datadb`: `15000+2*i+1`

## Running the nodes
- `cd` into `./setup`
Start the coordinator:
`python3 start_coordinator.py 
        --host localhost:16000 
        --participant localhost:16001 
        --participant localhost:16002 
        --log-db postgresql://:15001 
        --batch-size 3 --timeout 3`

Start a participant
- `cd` into `./setup`
`python3 main.py 
--node-id 0 
--host localhost:16001 
--log-db 
postgresql://:15002 
--data-db postgresql://:15003 
--coordinator localhost:16000`

Start a client from the root directory to send insert requests to the coordinator:

    python3 client.py --coordinator localhost:16000


## Project Deliverables Status

- [x] Logging functionality
- [x] Data storage functionality
- [x] Dynamic query execution of client
- [x] Implementation of two-phase commit protocol
- [x] Handling of upto one node failure

## Outline of code

`start_coordinator.py`: Runs the Coordinator node. It uses asyncio for asynchronous execution and argparse for parsing command-line arguments. The coordinator communicates with participant nodes, coordinates their actions, and manages transaction logs stored in a PostgreSQL database. Listens for commands, sets up the coordinator node, and handles shutdown gracefully.

`start_participant.py`: Runs the Participant node. Employs asyncio for asynchronous execution and argparse for parsing command-line arguments. The participant communicates with the coordinator node, manages its own data and transaction logs stored in PostgreSQL databases, and handles graceful shutdown upon receiving termination signals.

`coordinator.py`: Implements a two-phase commit protocol coordinator, managing transaction processes among various nodes. It coordinates the actions of participants, ensuring all nodes reach a consensus on commit or abort decisions before executing transactions.

`node.py`: Defines the base functionality for a node within a two-phase commit system, supporting basic network operations and transaction state management. This includes functionalities like writing to the logs, setting up basic RPC client/server etc.

`participant.py`: Represents a participant node in a two-phase commit system, handling specific commands such as prepare, commit, and abort from the coordinator. It ensures that actions on the database are executed according to the coordinatorâ€™s directives and maintains logs for transaction recovery.

`client.py`: Provides interface to dynamically send requests to the system and execute queries.
